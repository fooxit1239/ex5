# numbers manipulation
Ex1:
The program receives a 2 digits number.
if 1 of the digits is 5,the program prints "PAM" (why?because i like it)
if 1 of the digits is 7,the program prints "BOOM"
if it has 5 or 7 in it, the program prints "BOOM PAM"
if the digits sum is 5 or 7,the program prints "GOOD"
if the number doesn't contain 5 of 7,the program prints "BAD FORMAT"
Ex2:
The program receives 2 numbers: 5 and 7.
it prints the modulo of 7 divided by 5.
without using the operators: -,/,%
next,the program prints the multipication of 5 & 7
without using the operators: -,/,%,*
next,the program prints the divition of 35 by 5
without using the operators: -,/,%,*
in this project, there is a logical way to solve the problem and the java function way for an easier getaway.
